      <p> First of all, let's see some basic informations about his life. 
      Born on March 27, 1980, in Bologna, Italy, Cremonini developed a passion for music at a young age and embarked on a remarkable journey that would establish him as one of the most prominent figures in the Italian music industry.

Growing up in a family that appreciated the arts, Cesare Cremonini was exposed to various musical genres from an early age. He began playing the piano at the age of six and quickly discovered his innate talent for music. As he honed his skills, Cremonini started writing his own songs, showcasing his creativity and knack for storytelling.
In 1996, Cremonini formed the band Senza Filtro with some of his friends; its name was changed in Lùnapop in 1997. The group gained much popularity, thanks to their infectious pop-rock sound and catchy songs. Their debut album, "...Squérez?" released in 1999, became a commercial success in Italy and spawned several hit singles. Cesare's distinctive voice and charismatic stage presence quickly made him a fan favorite.
However, despite the band's success, Cesare Cremonini felt the need to pursue a solo career to explore his artistic vision further. In 2002, he released his first solo album, "Bagus," which showcased a more introspective and mature sound compared to his earlier work with Lùnapop. The album received critical acclaim, and Cremonini's solo career was off to a promising start.

Over the following years, Cesare Cremonini continued to release a string of successful albums, each displaying his growth as an artist and his ability to connect with audiences on a profound level. His music became known for its emotional depth, tackling love, loss, and personal introspection themes. Cremonini's distinctive voice, characterized by its soulful timbre and emotive delivery, further solidified his position as one of Italy's most beloved musicians.

Some of his most notable albums include "Maggese" (2005), "1999-2010 The Greatest Hits" (2010), "La teoria dei colori" (2012), and "Possibili Scenari" (2017). These albums spawned numerous chart-topping singles, earning Cremonini numerous awards and accolades throughout his career.
Beyond his musical accomplishments, Cesare Cremonini is known for his philanthropic endeavors and dedication to social causes. He has been involved in various charitable initiatives, using his platform and resources to positively impact society. </p>

    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"> And now, let's discover some curiosities of Cremonini's life!
      Did you know that his song “Qualcosa di Grande – Something Big",  which won the 2000 edition of Festivalbar, was written by Cremonini when he was very young, during his elementary school period?  It is the singer-songwriter himself who declares this with a post on his Instagram profile, accompanied by photos of the sheet with the first draft of the song, in which he also explains how the idea for the song was born: he eavesdropped on a discussion that was taking place in class between a boy and a girl, classmates of the very young Cesare.
Isn’t that such a very cool fact?

      <p> In addition, as you probably already know, the Bolognese street called Via D’Azeglio each year hosts the installation of luminaries that pay tribute to great Bolognese personalities connected to the world of music.

On the occasion of Christmas 2019 on that street luminarias were lit with the words of Cremonini’s song “Nobody Wants to be Robin.” Those words continued to light up the streets of downtown Bologna until March 2020 when, at Cremonini’s own behest, they were auctioned off and the proceeds were donated to fund the strengthening of intensive care facilities in Emilia-Romagna region, engaged in COVID-19 emergency.</p>

      <p> A further interesting fact about the artist Cesare Cremonini is the connection with the great Lucio Dalla, which is not limited to the hometown that they have in common. In fact, Cremonini feels very close to the singer-songwriter, so much so that he dedicated one of his most successful songs, Io e Anna – published in his 2014 album LOGICO – a sort of sequel to the famous Anna and Marco by Lucio Dalla.</p>

      <p> Furthermore, another artist to whom Cesare is closely linked is Freddie Mercury (and Queen in general). This great love goes back to a record by the British group given to him by his father when he was just an adolescent. According to one of his reports, when he was young his schoolmates only listened to Nirvana while he could not help but start his days with Love Of My Life. Indeed Cremonini has paid many tributes to Queen during his career: one of them is a cover of Love Of My Life. However, the very first tributes to the British group were the tattoo of Freddie Mercury’s face on his arm and the writing of the preface of a book dedicated to them. Cremonini even mentioned them in one of his songs, A Better Day, partly inspired to the Queen’s song “Mr. Bad Guy”. </p>
